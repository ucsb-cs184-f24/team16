# Contributing

These are the general guidelines:

1. Any code-related changes must be made via pull requests.
2. All pull requests should be linked to an issue on the Kanban board.
3. Use squash and merge to merge changes.

## Steps to contributing code

1. Add an issue on the Kanban board. See below for more detailed guidelines.
2. Create a new branch from `main`, and start coding there.
3. After you are done coding, create a pull request.
   - Remember to add "closes" followed by the issue tag. For an example, check [this pull request](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/team16/pull/9).
   - If your changes are unmergeable, rebase changes from `main`.
4. After your pull request is approved by another team member, squash and merge.
   - If the issue is P0, you may skip the review process if the deadline is near.

## Kanban board

1. Sprints are called iterations. When creating an issue for this sprint, remember to add it to the current iteration.
2. Priority specifies how important an issue is.
   - P0: Issues that must be resolved in the near future (i.e. two days).
   - P1: Any other issues necessary for the project.
   - P2: All other issues
3. Our story points are in two-hour units. The estimate field is an estimate of the number of story points.

## Issues

Please fill out these fields whenever creating an issue:

- Priority
- Size
- Estimate

If an issue should be resolved in the current sprint, fill out the Iteration field.

When starting an issue, fill out the Start date field.

When closing an issue, fill out the End date field.
