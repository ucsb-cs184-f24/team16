# Problem Scenario

[//]: # (TODO: Write a story of how someone might use this app)

Example Persona: Jack, 19, a UCSB student

Story: Jack is a second year UCSB computer science student and he has a lot of courses this quarter. Jack does not want to add each course's class time and assignments manually on his calendar, so he uses our app which automatically arranges all the lecture times, assignments and tests for him.
