Here is the design of the two main pages (the landing page and hamburger bar page) of our app:

### the landing page
I maintained the original layout of our app (the most important feature: calendar).
Changes are made mainly on the header seciton:
On the left of the header, there is a button to expand the hamburger bar page. 
On the right of the header, there is a plus-sign button which is for adding user's personal events. 
Thus, the main page will be more organized and interactive for users to look at. 

### the hamburger bar page
When users press the button to expand the hamburger menu, a panel appears on the right side of the screen.

At the top of the panel, the username is displayed.
Below that is the filtering section, where users can select checkboxes to specify the types of events they want to display on their calendar.
Users also have the option to export their calendar directly from this menu.
The "Quarter Info" button provides access to detailed quarter information, such as passtimes, quarter names, and schedules.
The Settings section allows users to view and manage the app's configuration options.
Finally, users can log out by clicking the Logout button at the bottom of the menu.
This layout ensures that all key functionalities are easily accessible and clearly organized.
