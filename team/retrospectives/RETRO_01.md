## Retro Assessment

* We used the start/stop/continue retro template to frame our retrospective discussion, where everyone was given a chance to elaborate on the start/stop/continue points
* It went pretty well. Everyone got a chance to participate in the discussion and overall we were able to do a deep introspection into ourselves in terms of what we have been doing well as a team and what we can do to improve/enhance the work+learning experience
