# HW04 Planning meeting

## General features we want to add

1. Add a hamburger menu to out app (includes UCSB login, Canvas login, Profile, and logout feature, etc.)
2. Calendar could be filtered based on the events users want to see
3. Users can also custom their own events

## Initial Ideas
### Implementation: Ziyang Huang


### Evaluation: Boming Kong


### Design/UX: Leyang Ni
I will use Figma to design the hamburger bar, profile page, and quarter info page. I will also slightly modify the layout of the main calendar page based on the changes we want to make (especially if we want to change the login method). 

### Process/Leadership: Tiger Yu
