## Sprint 02
### The What: What will we do
1. Do API calls.
2. Collect information necessary for filling up the calendar. 

### The How: How will we do it
1. Complete three API calls. 
2. For the first API call (USCB general calendar), collect information including start_date, end_date, and finals.
3. For the second API call: Get the schedule and information for individual courses (category, time, period, location)
4. The last API call (Canvas): canvas assignments. (Maybe requires multiple API calls)
